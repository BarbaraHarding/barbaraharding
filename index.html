  <h1>My Personal Information</h1>
  <p> Barbara Harding s3824203 barbaraharding7@bigpond.com</p>
 	<p>I was born in Dandenong, Victoria, to English parents. I grew up in the 70s and have 2 kids of my own who are 28 & 27 years old. 
The only language I speak fluently is English, however I have started to learn French and Russian via Duolingo as a substitute for Social media time and I am loving it. 
I completed a Diploma of Horticulture in 2005 which was my first tertiary education course, and in my spare time I love ballroom dancing, walking and hiking.</p>
 
	<p>My current employment is in a wholesale production nursery in the south eastern suburbs of Melbourne where I look after the data and record systems. 
I have recently decided that there may not be enough of a mental challenge in this role, horticulture is not known for it’s IT advances, so I decided to look at furthering 
my education. After many discussions with friends and family who are far more versed in these industries than I am, I have decided to attempt a degree in Information 
Technology and Data Analytics, and this course is the first IT step toward achieving that. I have not thus far been exposed to any IT work other than creating a very 
simple set of spreadsheets and data reports. Jumping in the deep end with this course at RMIT is quite scary, but I am loving it so far. </p>

<h1>My ideal job would be Data Analyst</h1>
 
<p>The job requires skills in mathematics, understanding and using IT for data collection and manipulation. 
Data analysts must be able to define where information comes from and what is missing as well as interpreting the data that is available. 
Being able to understand the question paramount.</p>  
<p>I love looking at information and trying to work out how to organise and interpret the information so that it becomes useful. 
The skills I have thus far to prepare for this role are a very basic understanding of what a data set looks like, I am able to define a problem and set a path to solving this. 
There are many skills I need to develop before I am ready for this role. The first one is to complete a Degree course in Information Technology and Data Analytics and improve 
my mathematics. This is my current very ambitious goal. </p>

<h1>My Personal Profile</h1>

<h3>Which Learning Style is best for you? (Blazevic 2018)</h3>
<p>Visual – use highlighters, colour codes, watch videos, visualise the problem. Work better when you can see what you’re learning. </p>

<h3>Big Five Personality Test - Open Source Psychometrics</h3>

<p>Factor I  was labelled as Extroversion by the developers of the IPIP-BFFM. Factor I is sometimes given other names, such as Surgency or Positive Emotionality. Individuals who score high on Factor I one are outgoing and social. Individuals who score low tend to be shut ins. Score: 96 percentile
Factor II is labelled as Emotional Stability. Factor II is often referred to by other names, such as Neuroticism or Negative Emotionality (in these two cases interpretations are inverted, as Neuroticism and Negative Emotionality can be thought of as the opposite of Emotional Stability). Score: 74 percentile
Factor III is labelled as Agreeableness. A person high in agreeableness is friendly and optimistic. Low scorers are critical and aggressive. Score: 95 percentile
Factor IV is labelled as Conscientiousness. Individuals who score high on this factor are careful and diligent. Low scorers are impulsive and disorganized. Score: 80 percentile
Factor V is labelled as Intellect/Imagination. This factor is also often called Openness to Experience. People who score low tend to be traditional and conventional. Score: 96 percentile</p>

<p>Some of these tests have shown me to be an extrovert and others show more highly introverted. I think I can be either under the appropriate circumstances. 
I work well in a team and my main focus is always what is best for the individual and the group. 
After completing these test I am very comfortable fitting into a team and using my own skills to support others. </p>

<h1>My IT Project</h1>

<p>My passion has just been validated completely by the personality  and learning tests that I have just completed, and in light of that my ultimate IT project would be to create a program or way of collecting and collating data to analyse, define and assess risk factors contributing to domestic and personal violence in our communities, and use this to assist health and community services in appropriation of resources within our community to better mitigate risks to safety of workers in the field and the safety of at-risk members of the public.</p>
<p>This project is important because so much attention is focussed on personal safety in our communities. There is a direct correlation between environment and the risk of personal safety incidence and with the sheer volume of data available from so many public sources there must be a way of collecting and filtering this data to better analyse and predict risk factors without infringing on individual privacy.</p>
<p>This project centres around collection of publicly available social data and using this data to gain a clearer understanding of the source of risk to health of members of our community who most need outside help to mitigate that risk. There is so much social data available today that could be used to identify persons who are at risk, or maybe more clearly define the risk surrounding a particular individual so that we, as a community can better protect them. The aim is to use data collected to pinpoint high risk triggers for violence and other safety concerns within our communities so that we can assess these and as a community provide better protection for at-risk members of the public and health and service workers. </p>
<p>The project would benefit the whole of our community by improving the safety of our most at-risk community members such as children, people with disabilities, victims of domestic violence, members of marginalised social groups.</p>   
<p>There are many dangers in attempting a project such as this, and privacy is just one of them. Collecting large amounts of data about people is dangerous, especially data that can be used to identify individuals. Privacy laws are in place to protect everyone and must be respected. Some of the obstacles include; who has access to the data and who makes a judgement call in any given case. What parameters are set around data collection and who sets the parameters. How is the data stored and for how long. Which services would have access to information on individuals and how much access does each service get? And then, who makes that decision?  Even if the project only uses publicly available data there is still so very much room for risk in collection and use that the set up would be vitally important.</p>    
<p>As a novice in the IT field, I think the tools and technologies that are required for this project are still unknown to me. It is completely over-ambitious at this stage for me to try and list actual available tools, as I am not sure I am able to explain well enough for my own comfort the tools I am being exposed to within the course so far, let alone others that I am required to find and define for this project. Suffice to say the project requires a data collection technique, a collaborative platform for data management, access for a team to manage and analyse the collected data. And a set of publicly trusted overseers to manage the rules of the project and keep it accountable. </p>
<p>The skills required for this project include a legal understanding around the privacy act, data collection and use; Data collection skills; Community health experience; Data analysis.</p> 
<p>Software for data collection and categorisation and security will be required.  Public health and emergency services experts are required for consultation.</p>
<p>When this project is successful, the outcome will be that social and emergency services will have a clearer set of parameters to work within when allocating resources in communities. There will be clearer guidelines for assessing risks in individual cases leading to fewer cases falling through the cracks and overall improved community wellbeing.</p>
